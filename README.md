## Observations
- Target the Affordable EV Segment:
India is a price-sensitive market, and the majority of consumers are in the middle-income bracket. Launching affordable EVs can help capture a larger market share, especially in urban and semi-urban areas where the demand for cost-effective, eco-friendly transportation is growing. Offering competitively priced models that qualify for government subsidies and incentives can further reduce the cost for consumers, making EVs more accessible.

- Invest in Charging Infrastructure Partnerships:
 A key challenge in the Indian EV market is the lack of robust charging infrastructure. Partnering with local governments, energy companies, and private businesses to develop a widespread network of charging stations can address range anxiety, which is a major concern for potential EV buyers. Offering bundled solutions, such as home charging stations or discounts at partner charging stations, can also enhance the appeal of your vehicles.

- Build a Strong After-Sales Service Network:
Establishing trust is crucial for a new brand, especially in a market like India where consumers are cautious about new technology. Developing a reliable and accessible after-sales service network, including service centers in key locations, offering comprehensive warranty packages, and providing roadside assistance, can build confidence among buyers
